# KivyTileMapper
Generates portable pixmaps of your levels, from spritesheets and Kivy .atlas files,  
to be used in whatever game you design.

First you'll need Python.  Linux and OSX users should be fine as-is.
Win users might need to download it from their website
https://www.python.org/downloads/

I used v3.4.2 to create this, so version 3 or higher is recommended.
It's possible it'll run in fine in v2.7x - The code is simple,
and I think Kivy does OK on either, so whatever's clever, ya know?

------
Then you'll need Python's package installer, pip.
Pip should come with Python, but if not...

- Linux:
`sudo apt-get update && apt-get install pip pip3`

- OSX:
`sudo easy_install pip`

- Win:
if you don't have it, it's probably best to
download a new version of Python from their website.

------
**Use pip to install Kivy**

- Linux:
`pip3 install kivy`

- OSX:
`python -m pip install kivy`

- Windows:
`py -m pip install kivy`

------
Alright, once you're certain you have Python and Kivy,
you can **run the KivyTileMapper**

- Linux:
`./main.py`

- OSX:
`./python -m main.py`

- Win:
`py -m main.py`
